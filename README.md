## What's HAY?
HAY is an acronym of "How Are You". It's also an Open Source social media that respect your privacy and doesn't track you! It's 
a website from the OM Project (has no relation with the soccer/football (US or UK? :p) club, myself don't like sport).
### Who are we?
We're a little french and tunisian teams that suggest an alternative to other social media! We believe in Open Source and we 
want to create a better internet for everyone.

### Why do you use Symfony for your project?
> Because having a common convention is essential to have a clear code! And we use Symfony because it's a simple and Open Source

> working in group.
